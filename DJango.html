        Django is a Python framework that makes it easier to create web sites using Python.
        Django takes care of the difficult stuff so that you can concentrate on building your web applications.
        Django emphasizes reusability of components, also referred to as DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), and comes with ready-to-use features like login system, database connection and CRUD operations (Create Read Update Delete).
